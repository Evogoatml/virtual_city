GhostGoat Service Registry
Clean separation layer between subsystems — each service has a well-defined
interface and is independently addressable.

Why:
  Proper separation lowers latency.  When subsystems talk through explicit
  service interfaces rather than direct imports, each path only pays for
  the services it actually uses.  Services can be swapped, mocked, or
  run remotely without touching callers.

Usage:
    from core.kernel.service_registry import registry

    # Register a service (usually done in the subsystem's init)
    registry.register("memory", my_memory_instance)

    # Look up a service (returns None if not registered)
    mem = registry.get("memory")

    # Or get with a factory (lazy init on first access)
    mem = registry.get_or_create("memory", factory=lambda: MemoryService())
